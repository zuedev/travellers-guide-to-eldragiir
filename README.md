# Traveller's Guide to Eldragiir

> Birthed from the embers of war and left to rot by its creators, the world of Eldragiir is a chaotic realm of mad-gods and foolish mortals. Forces clash for control over precious artefacts left behind by a once-great ancient civilisation known as "the Precursors." With dark entities festering and scheming between the folds in the fabric of reality, to live here is to know strife and betrayal.

## Information

Eldragiir is a worldbuilding project born from playing countless hours of Dungeons & Dragons. Inspired heavily from media I was exposed to in my life, I hope to one day be able to share this with others in a more significant way.
