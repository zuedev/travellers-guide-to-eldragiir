# Preface

> ​A dwarven male, clad in fine leather armour and golden plate, splashes his face with cold water in front of a mirror. His gaze unnatural and eery, with bright-yellow eyes resembling that of a serpent. Interrupted by a knock on the door, his supernatural visage fades into that of a typical dwarf. A voice follows from the other side: "It's starting sir, the captain summons you."
>
> ​"It's time," he mutters to himself in reply, sheathing a dagger laced with an absinthe-green liquid.
>
> ​The dwarf walked out onto the deck of a ship aloft in the sky, held up by a whirring sea-blue crystal. Taking position beside an armoured human female, an image of the world burns into view around him with the clashing orchestra of a battle raging below.

## Using this Guide

This guide is designed to be read by game masters and worldbuilders looking to run or create content for the fantasy world of Eldragiir. It will give you a comprehensive overview of the setting, its history, and its inhabitants, as well as provide you with tools and resources to help you run your own games in this world. We recommend running games in Eldragiir using the fifth edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game, Dungeons & Dragons, but the information in this guide can be adapted to any system.

## Setting Introduction

Eldragiir is an enormous setting that includes: Worlds, Continents, Cities, and Treasures. It is separated into several dimensions that are linked together via special anchors, portals, and even through powerful magics and rituals. Each dimension has its own rich history, factions, and locations. All of this allows the opportunity for telling countless stories and grand adventures.

This chapter will introduce you to most of the aspects of the world without too much detail to help set the stage for further explanation. We'll be exploring the following topics:

- **Eldragiir's origin legend.** Where great ancient beings, known only as "the Precursors," forged the worlds out of the necessity to create.
- **The Cataclysm.** A recent event in present history that shook the very foundations of the worlds and beset Eldragiir into chaos.
- **Many realms, one domain.** There are several different worlds and interlinking planes in Eldragiir, all with their own histories and critical locations.
