# Alcazaar "Eli" Lastrange

As the de facto "big bad evil guy" for most of my D&D campaigns, Alcazaar was originally my first-ever player character. His history evolved over the years, turning from a morally-good self-insert to a much more sinister catalyst for conflict in the world. Each iteration may vary in intent and methods but generally share a central and pivotal antagonistic role in the story. In summary, Alcazaar always starts with good intentions but is ultimately betrayed and corrupted beyond saving.

## Prime

> "The Prime Continuity" is the name given to a version of the world's lore I use in most of my work. Elements of my work may be affixed with "Prime" to indicate this.

### Appearance

He wears unassuming leather travelling garb, a coat with a scarf typically worn to cover his mouth, and gloves that expose his thumb and index finger on his right hand. He stands 6'1" tall with a muscular build typical of a human male. The only features of note are a leather-bound tome laden to his left ribcage underneath his coat and a small sheathe for a walnut-wooden wand under his forearm which covers the arm of his jacket.

#### True

Standing 6'3" tall, battered, and almost entirely bandaged from head to toe in tattered and bloody gauze. With emerald-green eyes peering through what little unbandaged part of his head reveals, he stares intently with a somewhat scowling expression. His ears give away his highly feyous heritage, exposing themselves sharply out of the sides of his head. What little skin you can see is clearly charred a pitch-black and scarred chaotically with almost neon-green glowing wounds and flaws of arcanic origin. From his posture and stance, you can tell he has a more lithe build than humans, with more quadrate proportions to his body. He wields an oak wand and an accursed tome of Lolth, the Spider Queen of the Dark Seldarine pantheon, strapped to his ribcage.
